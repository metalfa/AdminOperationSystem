(VIEW THIS FILE IN MARKDOWN TAB OTHERWISE IT WONT MAKE SENSE)
So basically
- `aos-files/calculator_engine.py` [(src)](https://replit.com/@mkcodes/calculator-working#main.py?v=1) should be refactored into aos as `class math: [..]` (maybe add enough features to compete with math/numpy/c/graphighnt hisng/whatever module one day)
- `aos-files/graphics_engine.py` [(src)](https://replit.com/@mkcodes/winter-blitz#main.py?v=1)         should be refactored into aos as `class graphix: [..]`
- maybe awesome soung engine?
Otherwise the code will become messy. 
Also we should try to maybe edit the code further for one unified coding style for easier mantainability?

Also `@`**`DeadWither`** since u do docs can u pls add calculator_engine.py docs? now its not the weekends so i dont have much time except for gaps in school lol
